    <h2>Why Zenray?</h2>
    <p>In an age where mental wellness is paramount, the need for affordable and portable light therapy devices is on the rise.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <img src="./circuit_ard.svg" alt="Circuit Diagram" class="product-image">
    <p>Zenray is built around two main circuits, one to control the MAX72xx and one to control the LED lights. The web interface is hosted on the ESP 32 chip itself, making it easy for users to manage their therapy sessions.</p>

    <h2>Research-backed Results</h2>
    <p>Zenray utilizes red light therapy and flickering light therapy, both of which are supported by extensive research. Red light therapy is known to boost ATP production, which is often lowered in cases of depression and anxiety disorders. Flickering light therapy, on the other hand, has been found to work faster than antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of depression. It also aids mindfulness by producing gamma waves in the brain, similar to the effects of meditation.</p>
